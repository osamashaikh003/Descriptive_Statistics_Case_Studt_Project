# Descriptive Statistics Case Study: Employees Dataset

This project performs a descriptive statistical analysis on the "Employees Dataset" to understand the distribution and key characteristics of employee-related data.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based case study that explores the "Employees Dataset" (available from [Link to Dataset Source, e.g., Kaggle, internal company data]). The primary focus is to:

* Calculate and interpret descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.).
* Visualize data distributions using histograms, box plots, and other relevant plots.
* Identify patterns and potential outliers in the employee data.

## Dataset

The "Employees Dataset" contains information about employees, including [Briefly describe the key features, e.g., age, salary, department, job title, years of experience].
